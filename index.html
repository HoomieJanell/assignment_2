                In only 2.5 years, I received a Bachelor of Arts degree from
                Texas A&M University, College Station, where I majored in
                Communication, minored in Psychology, and graduated Magna Cum
                Laude with a 3.8 GPA. Following graduation, I moved to Austin,
                Texas, where I made my way into the tech industry and worked as
                a Content Quality Associate at the Favor Delivery Headquarters.
                There, I built out menus for the app and also sparked an
                interest in coding.

              In June of 2019, I became a Business Development Representative at
              LogicMonitor, a SaaS-based and agentless IT monitoring solution
              that provides visibility into both on-prem and cloud environments
              from a single UI. Although doing outbound sales for a software
              company can be interesting, I wanted to pursue more technical
              roles. In order to do so, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp at the
              University of Texas at Austin, where I learned full stack
              development, while at the same time balancing my full-time
              position as BDR. After receiving my Certificate in Full-Stack
              Development, I attained a position as Junior Web Developer, where
              I'm currently able to continue to grow and expand my knowledge and
              skill set.
