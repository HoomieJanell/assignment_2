            <p class= "bio">In only 2.5 years, I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and recieved a Bachelor of Arts in Communication
                and minor in Psychology from Texas A&M University. Following graduation, I worked a temporary postion in
                Content at the Favor Delivery Headquarters in Austin, TX until I moved into a more permanent position as
                Business Development Representative at LogicMonitor. Although doing outbound sales for a software
                company
                can be interesting, I wanted to pursue more technical roles and learn software and web development with
                the
                hopes of becoming an engineer. While continuing my full time job as a BDR, I have also enrolled in a
                coding
                bootcamp at the University of Texas, where I am learning full-stack development. After graduation in
                April
                2020, I hope to gain a more technical position in development/engineering.</p>
